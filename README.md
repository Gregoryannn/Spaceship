# Spaceship
Single player arcade game 🚀 🪐 🌌

Classic single player game.
I did it with the help of the udemy courses. I added my own solutions to this game.
The game created with using new not supported private classes methods. The game isn' t working on Firefox.
Enjoy the game!


## How to play?
You control your ship with left and right arrow. The shot is fired using a spacebar.</br>
Eliminate enemy ships and don't let them get on your site. Enemy ships speed increases as points increase. Get as many points as possible.
</br></br></br>


## My solutions
I added some code improvements. I changed shoot listener. Now if you hold down a space bar, the shoot will automatically after one second. If you start new game the missiles are removed from playing field.
